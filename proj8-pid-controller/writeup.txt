P: indicate how drastic the car reacts to being off-center
D: counter the other 2 factors to stablize the car
I: counter any systemic adjustments car needs to make, like mechanic errors and the shape of the road (in a turn, curved road, straight road)

I started with ignoring the I, D term, at a low speed, find a Kp value that makes the car move relatively close to the center line overall (at least on the straight road), I settled with 0.1. The problem at this point is that car makes big adjustments in turns and goes into big back and forth movements and not able to recover. So I added the D term to stablized the path, which I settled with 1.0, at this point car can drive around the loop for the most part (goes off road for some sections but mostly good), the thing I observe is that it goes off road on sharp turns, in theory I term should help with this issue. So I start experimenting with the I term, but with the additional term path becomes unstable again, so I increased the D term to 5.0, and I settled with 0.001 for the I term. Now the car can drive smoothly around the track no problem. And turns out this set of params can handle throttle up to 0.8 safely, which is pretty decent.
